  Standard container for Multiple Object Spectrograph data

description: |
  This is the standard container for Multiple Object Spectrograph data.
  It is expected that the data contained have been calibrated and each
  object extracted (in some manner) as an individual spectrum. That 
  spectrum may have more than one spatial location (e.g., it may be
  a single spatial point, 1d spatial data, or 2d spatial data 
  corresponding to 1-d, 2-d and 3-d data arrays respectively).

  fields:
    description: |
      A list of the names of fields used to identify categories of the
      spectral data, e.g., target_id, observataion_id, aperture_id, etc.
      In particular, the combination of the values for all the keys
      should uniquely identify one of the data items. These values
      are joined to form a single string used as the key value in the 
      dictionary the data are stored in using the field_separator as 
      the character or string separating the values. It is presumed
      that the name corresponds to an attribute of the data object

        name:
          description: |
            Descriptive name for the field. Intended to be used by 
            software as the name for selecting subsets for the values
          type: string
        data_attribute:
          description: |
            The attribute path in the data object the value is obtained from.
          type: string
        field_type:
          description: |
            A single character that indicates whether the field value 
            is a string or an integer. This is used in converting the 
            value obtained from the key to that used by the data if it
            an integer instead of a string.

    description: |
      The string or character used to join the field values to form
      the dictionary key.

  datasets:
    description: |
      The holder of all extracted spectra and associated information. 
      All spectra are keyed by a unique key as constructed from the
      field values as defined above.
