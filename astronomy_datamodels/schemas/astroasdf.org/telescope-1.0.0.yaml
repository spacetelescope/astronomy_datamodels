    type:
      string
  location:
    description: |
      An object with sufficient information to describe the location of the telescope
      in a standard coordinate system. For ground-based telescopes this may simply be a
      set of latitude, longitude, altitude values (and eventually solar system object);
      for spacecraft, it may contain a model object of some sort that provides location
      as a function of time in a standard coordinate system; or a cartesian coordinate
      in a defined solar system coordinate system.
