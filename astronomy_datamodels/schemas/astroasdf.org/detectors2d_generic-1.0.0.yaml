title: |
  Information about the instrument used 

description: |
  This contains information about the detector used and the
  configuration used for the observation. This type is for all detectors
  that don't fall into other standard types.

tag: "tag:stsci.edu/datamodels/detector2d_generic-1.0.0"
type: object
properties:
  name:
    description: |
      Standard name for the detector (nominally should match the key used
      in the instruments detectors property).
    type: string
  generic_description:
    description: |
      String to describe the detector type
  size:
    description: |
      number of pixels in each dimension of the full detector used for
      science data.
    type: array
    items: [number, number]
  binning:
    description: |
      The binning, if any used for these data
    type: array
    items: [number, number]
  subarray:
    description:
      The subset of the detector used. If multiple subarrays are possible,
      they should result in multiple detector entries???? Hmmm, can't have
      multiple identical keys, so the detector name probably needs modification
      with a subarray-ID suffix.
    type: object
      properties:
        offset:
          description: |
            Offset of the start 
            of the subarray.
          type: array
          items: [number, number]
        size:

            Size of the subarray
          type: array

  meta:
    description: |
      A container for non standard information about the detector.
