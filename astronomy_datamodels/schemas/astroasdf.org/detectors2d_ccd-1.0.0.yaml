  Information about the instrument used

  This contains information about the ccd used and the
  configuration used for the observation

type: object
properties:
  name:
    description: |
      Standard name for the detector (nominally should match the key used
      in the instruments detectors property).
    type: string
  size:
    description: |
      number of pixels in each dimension of the full detector used for
      science data.
    type: array
    items: [number, number]
  binning:
    description: |
      The binning, if any used for these data
    type: array
    items: [number, number]
  subarray:
    description:
      The subset of the detector used. If multiple subarrays are possible,
      they should result in multiple detector entries???? Hmmm, can't have
      multiple identical keys, so the detector name probably needs modification
      with a subarray-ID suffix.

      properties:
        offset:
          description: |
            Offset of the start
