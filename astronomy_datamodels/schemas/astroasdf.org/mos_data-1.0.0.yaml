  Standard container for Multiple Object Spectrograph data

description: |
  This is the standard container for Multiple Object Spectrograph data.
  It is expected that the data contained have been calibrated and each
  object extracted (in some manner) as an individual spectrum. That 
  spectrum may have more than one spatial location (e.g., it may be
  a single spatial point, 1d spatial data, or 2d spatial data 
  corresponding to 1-d, 2-d and 3-d data arrays respectively).

          The holder of all extracted spectra and associated information. 
          All spectra are keyed by a unique key. The form of this key
          depends on whether the spectra are all in the same observation
          or not. For single observations, they key is typically an aperture
          ID of some sort. When multiple observations are combined into one
          file, they key may be a combination of aperture ID and exposure ID.

          The character used to split keys into multiple fields. In Python
          this results in keys turning into tuples.

      key_field_types:
        description: |
          This is used to indicate what types each key field (after separation)
          should be converted to, the options being string or integer. The 
          format of this field is simply a series of 's' and 'i' characters
          corresponding to the number of key fields.
