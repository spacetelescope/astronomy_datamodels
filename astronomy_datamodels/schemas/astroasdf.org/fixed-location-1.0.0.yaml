  of the telescope used when ground-based. May be on other solar system 
  objects.

      Identifies which body the ground coordinates are referenced to, currently 
      only solid bodies are included. Only moons with a radius greater than 
      100 km are included. Only asteroids with a radius larger than 500 km are
      included. Comets are excluded. [Perhaps this list is going overboard :-)]
